# PoEHelper

This project is at a very early stage of development. Eventually the expected functionality:

- Display the maze map and the contents of the current room (keys, darkshrine, arguments, etc.) based on information from poelab.com
- Trading help (displays inbound/outbound trade cards with price name, etc.)

***This application doesn't interact with game memory in any way, it only uses read log file Client.txt***
